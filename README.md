# [IN-PROGRESS] Template OS Project :wrench::nut_and_bolt::hammer: 
XyOS by Xyan Bhatnagar.
A 64-Bit micro-kernel written in C and Assembly designed to run on the Raspberry Pi 3B.

## This repo is the sole property of Xyan and I am using his implementation for academic purposes. 

## Goals
- [X] Get something to boot reliably. Get familiar with AArch64 concepts.
- [X] Get access to basic peripherals on the Raspberry Pi - GPIO, UART, Timers.
- [X] Enable software and hardware interrupts
- [X] Setup virtual memory for kernel and user space
- [ ] Implement synchronization primitives - Spinlocks, Locks, CVs and Semaphores.
- [ ] Implement concurrency primitives - Interrupts, Context Switching and Threads.
- [ ] Implement user space - processes, system calls, etc.
- [ ] Build an abstraction layer for higher level peripherals - USB, HDMI, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.
